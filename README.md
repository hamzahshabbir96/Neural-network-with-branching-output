# Neural network with branching output
This package can be used to train neural network for classification with option of multiple outputs by branching at different layers. 


__Features available__
- Customizable layers with option of selecting activation function
- No limits on adding number of layers and number of neurons in each layers
- By default gradient descent for optimization but in further version, other optimization methods are to be included
- Multiple outputs can be selected at different layers with just one method call

## Requirements
This package is developed at very low-level python coding so there is no much requirement other than numpy library.
